# SimpleTodo

This is a very simple "Todo" app for the codepath android course. This app currently supports three basic
operations: add, delete and edit. Plans to improve and extend the app are currently a work in progress.

* New improved UI.
* Added a feature to specify due date for todoItem (optional attribute).
* Highlighted row for items which are past the due-date
* New items added should go at the top of listView
* Search based on the name of the todoItem (Implemented using the search widget)
* Implemented option items for clearing expired items and deleting all the items
